<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<h2>THis is maven tomcat project!</h2>
<h3>Now, let's take a look at how to use the Tomcat Manager App. We have two options here â€” we can choose to use the web-based (HTML) application or the text-based web service.

The text-based service is ideal for scripting, whereas the HTML application is designed for humans.

The web-based application is available at:

http[s]://<server>:<port>/manager/html/
While the corresponding text service is available at:

http[s]://<server>:<port>/manager/text/
However, before we can access these services, we need to configure Tomcat. By default, it can only be accessed by users with the correct permissions.</h3>
